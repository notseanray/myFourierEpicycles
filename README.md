## myFourierEpicycles - you give me an image I give you its epicycles.

![]()

This is the code for a website I'm creating myFourierEpicyles.com. The site has the following functionality:

- Upload an image and find the its fourier epicycles.
- Draw in an image and find its fourier epicycles.

Something which makes this project differnet than other fourier epicycles websites, is that it allows users to upload any image of a variaty of forms (png, jpeg, svg, gif) and then.

In order to find the arbitrary path of any image type in a efficent way, I created a new api which can be found [here](https://github.com/trozler/ImageToPoints).

### Important notes

- For **most clear drawings** upload **svg** images with **closed** paths.

### How to install

- `git clone https://github.com/trozler/myFourierEpicycles.git`

### Understanding the Fourier Transfrom

For those curious, these resources are good starting points in understanding the fourier transform and the drawing of epicycles.
